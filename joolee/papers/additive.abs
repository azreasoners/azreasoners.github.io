An "additive" fluent is a fluent with numerical values such that the 
effect of several concurrently executed actions on it can be computed by
adding the effects of the individual actions.  We show how queries about
additive fluents can be answered using the Causal Calculator. The examples
discussed in this paper involve buying and selling, applying forces and
moving groups of objects.  The additive fluent mechanism can be used to
instruct the Causal Calculator to generate more efficient plans.
