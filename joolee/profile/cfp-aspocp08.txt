AIMS AND SCOPE

 Since its introduction in the 1990s, answer set programming (ASP) has
 been widely applied to various knowledge-intensive tasks and
 combinatorial search problems. ASP was found to be closely related to
 SAT, which has led to a new method of computing answer sets using SAT
 solvers and techniques adapted from SAT. While this has been the most
 studied relationship, the relationship of ASP to other computing
 paradigms, such as constraint satisfaction, quantified boolean
 formulas (QBF), or first-order logic (FOL) is also the subject of
 active research. New methods of computing answer sets are being
 developed based on the relation between ASP and other paradigms, such
 as the use of pseudo-Boolean solvers, QBF solvers, and FOL theorem
 provers. Furthermore, the practical application of ASP also fosters
 work on multi-paradigm problem-solving, and in particular language
 and solver integration. The most prominent examples in this area
 currently are the integration of ASP with description logics (in the
 realm of the Semantic Web) and constraint satisfaction.  This
 workshop will facilitate the discussion about crossing the boundaries
 of current ASP techniques, in combination with or inspired by other
 computing paradigms.


TOPICS

 Topics of interests include (but are not limited to):

 - Relating ASP to classical logic formalisms (SAT/FOL/QBF/SMT/DL).
 - Relating ASP to constraint programming.
 - Relating ASP to other logic programming paradigms.
 - Relating ASP to other nonmonotonic languages.
 - New methods of computing answer sets using algorithms or systems of
  other paradigms.
 - ASP and probabilistic reasoning.
 - ASP and machine learning.
 - Language extensions to ASP.
 - ASP and multi-agent systems.
 - Multi-paradigm problem solving involving ASP.
 - Evaluation and comparison of ASP to other paradigms.
 - Embedding ASP for challenging applications.
 - Hybridizing ASP with procedural approaches.
 - Enhanced grounding / beyond grounding.


SUBMISSIONS

 Papers must describe original research and should not exceed 15 pages
 in the Springer LNCS format <URL:http://www.springeronline.com/lncs/>.

 Paper submission will be handled electronically by means of the
 Easychair system. The submission page is available at

  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aspocp08 .


IMPORTANT DATES

 Submission Deadline:       September 25, 2008
 Notification:              October 20, 2008
 Camera-ready articles due: November 10, 2008
 Workshop:                  December 9-13, 2008 (exact day to be determined)


PROCEEDINGS

 The workshop contributions will be published electronically, using
 the Computing Research Repository (CoRR). Informal printed
 proceedings will be provided at the workshop. It is planned to
 publish significantly extended versions of selected contributions as
 post-proceedings, preferably as a special edition of a journal. The
 post-proceeding articles will be subject to a further peer-reviewing
 round.


LOCATION

 The workshop will be held in Udine, Italy, collocated with the
 International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP) 2008.
