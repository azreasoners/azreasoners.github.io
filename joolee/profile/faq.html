<ul>
<li> 
Q: "I am a CS/CSE undergrad. Can I get a prerequisite override to take your undergraduate course?" 
<br>
A: Please submit your override request to  https://fultonapps.asu.edu/override/# . 
   The Advising will manually grant the request.

<li> Q: "The class is full. Can I enroll with your permission?" 

<br>
 A: Sorry, I don't control seat numbers. There are good reasons why the cap is imposed. Usually, students switch
from one to another class in the first week of the semester. You may try to take the seats vacated by another student. 

<li> Q: "I'm a non-CSE major. Can I take your class?" 
<br> A: I can approve prerequisite override if you can show me that you're well prepared. Email me with your background info and qualification. 
CSE students have to meet the prerequisite.
