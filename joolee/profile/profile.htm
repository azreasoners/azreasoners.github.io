         Welcome!  I am an associate professor in
         <a href="http://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/" target="_top">the School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering (CIDSE)</a>

        University</a>.

I lead the <a href="http://reasoning.eas.asu.edu">Automated Reasoning Group at ASU</a>, 
which is part of the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/ai">AI Lab at ASU</a> and is one of the 
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/tag" target="_top">TAG</a> teams.

<p>
I am interested in designing and building intelligent systems, 
which can perform automated reasoning based on the knowledge represented in a formal language, thereby 
intelligently handling open-ended tasks by "thinking." Towards this end, I have been working on Knowledge 
Representation and Reasoning, Computational Logic, Logic Programming, Commonsense Reasoning,
Reasoning Under Uncertainty, Ontology Modeling, Cognitive Robotics, Security, and Question Answering. 

<p> More information and news can be found from my <a href="http://peace.eas.asu.edu/joolee/papers">publication page</a> 
and my <a href="http://reasoning.eas.asu.edu">research group homepage</a>.

   "The key insight might come to you only after you have spent hours in 
   formula manipulation and given up in frustration to work on some 
   nonintellectual task like riding your bike, mowing the lawn, or taking a 
   shower. The subconscious is a powerful thing, especially after you have 
   internalized the behavior of the symbols in your problem. 
   ( From <i>Computer-Aided Reasoning: An Approach</i>, p 113) "
