<b>Description:</b>

Beyond the study of proofs in mathematics, logic has been applied to
designing and reasoning about computer hardware and software. One of
the prominent applications of logic in computer science
is the use of logic for <b>declarative programming</b>.
<!--Declarative programming specifies <i>what</i> is to be computed,
but not necessarily <i>how</i> to compute.-->

<p>
<b>Answer set programming (ASP)</b> is a recent form of declarative programming 
oriented towards difficult combinatorial search problems, and has 
found to be useful in many knowledge-intensive applications. 
It has emerged from interaction between two lines of
research---on the semantics of negation in logic programming and on
applications of satisfiability solvers to search problems. 
<!-- It was identified as a new programming paradigm in 1999.  -->

The idea of ASP is to represent the search problem we are interested 
in as a logic program whose intended models, known as ``answer sets'',
correspond to the solutions of the problem, and then find them using
an <i>answer set solver</i> -- a system for computing answer sets. 

Applications of ASP include knowledge representation, plan generation, 
and product configuration problems in artificial intelligence and 
to graph-theoretic problems arising in VLSI design, in historical 
linguistics, and in bioinformatics. 
Fully declarative semantics of ASP makes it easy to write provably
correct programs, and allows 
easy communication between other users of computational methods besides 
computer scientists. The significance of this new approach is heightened 
by the multidisciplinary nature of collaborations and new computing areas 
that are emerging. For example,
<ul>
<li> <b>Automated Product Configuration:</b> An ASP-based technology
that has been commercialized ({\tt www.variantum.com/en}).

<li> <b>Decision Support for the Space Shuttle:</b> An ASP system has
been a part of autonomous control of the Space Shuttle.

<li> <b>Inferring Phylogenetic Trees:</b> An ASP-based method for
reconstructing a phylogeny for a set of taxa has been applied to historical
analysis of languages and of parasite-host systems.
</ul>

<p>
There will be no textbook; the necessary material will be handed out
in class. No prerequisite is needed, but general knowledge of
mathematical logic 
is recommended.  Your grade will be determined by class participation,
homework, two tests and one term project.

<!-- Your grade will be determined by your solutions to homework problems
and by class participation.-->
<!--<p>
<b>Prerequisites: </b>
Basic knowledge on mathematical logic (propositional
logic and first-order logic) will be assumed.  -->

<h3> Projects </h3>

Students completed non-trivial ASP programming tasks for their term projects. 

<ul> <h4>Undergraduate Student Projects</h4>
<li> Jacob Griffin, <a href="Projects/JakeGriffin.pdf">Paint by Numbers</a> <br>
       Jake formalized in ASP a type of grid puzzle called "Paint by Number", which is to complete a picture 
directed by constraints given by numbers.  He also implemented GUI in C#.net to make input of puzzles easier 
to test and show the pretty pictures. 
<p>
<li> Tylar Hoag, <a href="Projects/TylarHoag.pdf">Wumpus World</a><br>
Tylar formalized in ASP a reasonably restricted version of the Wumpus World, in which reasoning 
has to involve unknown environment. 
<p>
<li> Thomas Lang, <a href="Projects/TomLang.pdf">Some Variations of Sudoku</a><br>
Tom formalized in ASP three variations of Sudoku puzzles, for instance one involving 5 different 5x5 boards with one
board overlapping with the other four board. 
<p>
<li> Houston Murphy, <a href="Projects/HoustonMurphy.pdf">Jealous Husbands Puzzle</a><br>
Houston's project is to test elaboration tolerance of ASP language by formalizing some elaborations of 
Jealous Husbands Puzzle,  which is similar to Missionaries and Cannibals puzzle. He investigated how much of the code
can be reused, each time some elaborations have to taken into account.
<p>
<li> Matthew Roberson, <a href="Projects/MattRoberson.pdf">Using ASP to Solve Binary-Determination Logic Puzzles</a><br>
Matt formalized two grid puzzles "Kuromasu" and "Light up"  in ASP. 
<p>
<li> Richard Seale, <a href="Projects/RichardSeale.pdf">Rubik's Cube</a><br>
Richard's project is to formalize the movement of Rubik's cube and analyzed possible configurations of the puzzle using
ASP.
</ul>

<ul> <h4>Graduate Student Projects</h4>
<li> Michael Casolary, <a href="Projects/MichaelCasolary.pdf">Comparing Solver Performance Using Peg Solitaire</a><br>
Michael formalized a few Peg Solitaire games and analyzed the performance ASP solvers on this domain. He also formalized
the games in C+ and compared the performance with CCalc.  
<p>
<li> Benoit Catherinet, <a href="Projects/BenoitCatherinet.pdf">Endgame Chess</a><br>
Benoit investigated how to use ASP to prove a small theorems about Chess game, such as detecting checkmate.  
<p>
<li> Juraj Dzifcak, <a href="Projects/JurajDzifcak.pdf">Using CCG and Lambda Calculus together with the New ASP Semantics to Characterize NL sentences</a><br>
Juraj investigated how natural language sentences involving existential quantification can be represented in the new
language of stable models proposed in [Ferraris, Lee and Lifschitz, 2007].
<p>
<li> Tae-Won Kim, <a href="Projects/TaewonKim.pdf">Formalizing Korean Honorification in ASP</a><br>
Honorifics in Korean language has many sophisticated rules. Tae-won formalized these rules as ASP knowledge base, 
which can be used to infer speaker's relation from the use of honorific markers.
<p>
<li> Tuan Nguyen, <a href="Projects/TuanNguyen.pdf">Logic Programming Approach to Partial Satisfaction Planning</a><br>
Tuan formalized partial satisfaction planning problem in ASP, in which actions have cost and goals have reward. 
He applied the splitting theorem to prove if his encoding is correct.
