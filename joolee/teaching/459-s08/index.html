<b>Description: </b> 

Mathematical logic plays a fundamental role in various
areas of computer science :  computer architecture 
(Boolean logic, digital gates, hardware verification), 
software engineering (specification, verification), 
programming languages (semantics, type theory, logic 
programming), databases (relational algebra, database 
query language), artificial intelligence (automated 
theorem proving, knowledge representation), algorithms 
and theory of computation (complexity, computability, 
expressiveness), etc.

<p>
This course is an elementary but mathematically solid 
introduction to propositional and first order logic, 
and their applications in computer science.
You will learn logic mainly by doing homework problems, 
by presenting your solutions to the class, and by 
studying and discussing the solutions presented 
by others.  There is no textbook; the necessary theory 
and the statements of problems to discuss will be 
provided in a series of handouts.  You should make 
a serious effort to solve each of them.  Try to figure 
out solutions by yourself or in collaboration with 
other students, but not by asking someone who already 
knows the answers, and not by reading books.

<p>
In each handout, some problems are marked for class 
discussion. You are expected to volunteer to present 
your solutions to at least one of them (preferably 
more) at some point, which will earn you credit for 
class participation. These should be solutions that 
you found by yourself, without much help from others.

<p>
Several times during the semester you will receive 
e-mail messages with additional homework problems.
When you work on these additional problems, you may 
consult the materials handed out in class and your 
notes, but not any books, and you should not accept 
any help.

<p>
Your grade will be determined by class participation, 
homework submitted electronically, two midterms
and the final.
