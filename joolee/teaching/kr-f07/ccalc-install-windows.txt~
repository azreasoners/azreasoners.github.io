Installing CCalc on Windows
===========================

1. Download and install Cygwin: www.cygwin.com

2. Download the pre-compiled version of SWI Prolog "pl.exe.rename" from 

     http://peace.eas.asu.edu/joolee/teaching/kr-f07/pl.exe.rename

   and store it into c:\cygwin\usr\bin (assuming cygwin is installed
   under c:\cygwin). Rename the file as "pl.exe".

3. Download ccalc.zip file from 

     http://peace.eas.asu.edu/joolee/teaching/kr-f07/ccalc.zip , 

   and store it in a CCalc directory (e.g., c:\ccalc).

4. Unzip the file. 

5. Type "chmod -R 755 *" in the CCalc directory.

(In step 2, alternatively, one can download and install SWI-Prolog
 from the source code.)
