<h2>Running Cplus2ASP</h2>

<p class="text">
	Cplus2ASP can be run in two fundamentally different ways, via a single non-interactive command line specifying all required
	configuration information or in an interactive shell-like environment that allows for running with multilple queries and/or
	configurations.
</p>

<p class="text">
	In addition, the system can run in several different translator running modes which are used to fine-tune the system's behavior.
	A brief description of the translator modes is provided below.
</p>

Translator Modes:
<table class="indented-table" >
 <tr><th nowrap="nowrap">Incremental </th><td>-</td><td class="text"> 
	The default running mode. Utilizes a translation to incremental ASP in order to allow an incremental ASP solver to effeciently 
	iterate over all possible steps.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><th nowrap="nowrap">Reactive </th><td>-</td><td class="text"> 
 	This mode is under development and not available in this version.
	<!-- The default running mode when staticAbnormalities or dynamicAbnormalities are found. Uses a reactive ASP solver and incremental 
	translation to provide efficient online replanning. <span class="note">This mode is still highly experimental and incomplete. 
	See the <a href="./release_notes.html">release notes</a> for known limitations.</span> -->
</td></tr>
 <tr><th nowrap="nowrap">Static (auto)</th><td>-</td><td class="text"> 
	Uses the static translation used by previous version of Cplus2ASP. Automatically iterates and resolves for all requested steps until 
	a valid plan is found.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><th nowrap="nowrap">Static (manual)</th><td>-</td><td class="text"> 
	Similar to Static (auto) except that it allows the user to specify the steps to attempt to solve for.
 </td></tr>
</table>

<p class="text">
	Currently, the translator mode must be specified prior to calling the Cplus2ASP system. The arguments used
	to specify the translator modes are '--mode=incremental', '--mode=reactive', '--mode=static-auto', and '--mode=static-manual'
	for the Incremental, Reactive, Static (auto), and Static (manual) modes, respectively.
</p>

<p class="text">
	For the remainder of this tutorial, we assume that you have successfully obtained and installed the Cplus2ASP system and its
	dependencies. In addition, we assume that you have the file <a href="examples/nmct/monkey.cp">monkey.cp</a> in your current
	working directory.
</p>

<h3> Running Cplus2ASP from Command Line </h3>

<p class="text">
	The simplest way to run Cplus2ASP is by using the command-line arguments. If we want to run the planning query for the Monkeys 
	and Bananas problem (query 2), we can use the following command.
</p>

<pre class="code">
	cplus2asp monkey.cp query=2
</pre>

<p class="text">
	Which returns the plan shown below, indicating that the shortest sequence of actions for the monkey to obtain the bananas
	is [walk(l3), pushBox(l2), climbOn, graspBananas].
</p>

<pre class="code">
	0:  loc(bananas)=l2 loc(box)=l3 loc(monkey)=l1
	ACTIONS:  walk(l3)
	1:  loc(bananas)=l2 loc(box)=l3 loc(monkey)=l3
	ACTIONS:  pushBox(l2)
	2:  loc(bananas)=l2 loc(box)=l2 loc(monkey)=l2
	ACTIONS:  climbOn
	3:  loc(bananas)=l2 loc(box)=l2 loc(monkey)=l2 onBox
	ACTIONS:  graspBananas
	4:  hasBananas loc(bananas)=l2 loc(box)=l2 loc(monkey)=l2 onBox
</pre>

<p class="text">
	If we want to find a plan with a length of at least 6 we can specify a custom minimum step to solve for on the command line
	as follows.
</p>

<pre class="code">
	cplus2asp monkey.cp query=2 minstep=6
</pre>

<p class="text">
	This call actually returns 3 plans, one for each step between 4 (the shortest length plan) and 6 (the minimum length requested).
	<span class="note">This is because Clingo's algorithm results in all steps being solved for, regardless of the specified minimum
	step, which governs the minimum step before a solution stops the search.</span>
</p>

<p class="text">
	If we want to solve this issue we have to use a different translation mode (and thus grounder/solver). We can force Cplus2ASP
	to use the static-auto translation mode which uses the Clingo grounder/solver as follows:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	cplus2asp monkey.cp query=2 minstep=6 --mode=static-auto
</pre>

<p class="text">
	This instructs Cplus2ASP to use a static translation which requires complete re-grounding and solving for each step attempted
	but provides finer control over the steps that are solved for. Running this command results in one solution (with a length of
	6) being returned.
</p>

<p class="text">
	If we DO want to return multiple solutions, this can be requested by appending the number of solutions to find at the end of
	the command. For example, to find 3 solutions we would use the command below.
</p>

<pre class="code">
	cplus2asp monkey.cp query=2 minstep=6 --mode=static-auto 3
</pre>

<p class="text">
	Cplus2ASP's command interface is extremely robust and offers dozens of configuration options to explore. Each option is
	documented completely in the help dialog, which can be viewed by running the command.
</p>

<pre class="code">
	cplus2asp --help
</pre>


<h3> Running Cplus2ASP in Interactive Mode </h3>

<p class="text">
	Cplus2ASP also provides an interactive shell-like interface which supplements the command interface and allows
	users to actively reconfigure several key options and select new queries to run. In order to enter this interactive
	mode, simple run the Cplus2ASP command and neglect to include a query selection. An example command that will
	result in entering interactive mode is shown below.
</p>

<pre class="code">
	cplus2asp monkey.cp
</pre>

<p class="note">
	Notice that we still include the file to translate. Currently the interactive mode doesn't allow the user to select
	additional files to load, so these must be all specified ahead of time with command arguments.
</p>

<p class="text">
	After entering interactive mode, you're able to use a limited number of options, many of which are listed below.
</p>

<table class="indented-table">
<tr><th>query=ID</th>		<td>- Selects and runs the query ID listed above. </td>
<tr><th>sol=#</th>         	<td>- Sets the number of solutions to find to #.  </td>
<tr><th>maxstep=#</th>      <td>- Overrides the maximum step on the next query, setting it to # (or 'infinite' for no maxstep).  </td>
<tr><th>minstep=#</th>     	<td>- Overrides the minimum step on the next query, setting it to #.  </td>
<tr><th>help </th>          <td>- Displays the help dialog.  </td>
<tr><th>exit</th>           <td>- Exits the program.  </td>
</table>

<p class="text">
	For example, if we want to run query 2 as we did above, we could simply provide the command shown below, followed by a return.
</p>

<pre class="code">
	query=2
</pre>

<p class="text">
	Alternatively, if we wanted to find 3 of the possible solutions to the query with a minimum step of 5, we could input
	the following.
</p>

<pre class="code">
	sol=3
	minstep=5
	query=2
</pre>

<p class="text">
	In either case, the query is run with the specified parameters and afterward control returns to an identical prompt.
	<span class="note">It's important to note that certain options (such as the number of solutions to solve for) are
	kept between subsequent queries, meanwhile other options (like minstep and maxstep) are reset back to the default
	(or the values provided on the command line) after every run. </span>
</p>


<h3> Running Cplus2ASP v3 in Reactive Mode </h3>
<span class="note"> Not supported by cplus2asp v3.1. Support may be provided in future.</span>


<!-- See the <a href="https://webhost290.asu.edu:2222/CMD_FILE_MANAGER/domains/reasoning.eas.asu.edu/public_html/cplus2asp/examples/reactive.html">Reactive Mode</a> page.-->

<p class="text">
In reactive mode, oClingo is launched instead and is connected with the reactive bridge. The reactive bridge accepts input from the user in the form of an observation stream, translates it into online input for oClingo, runs oClingo, and then reports oClingo's output in the form of transition systems.
</p>

<p class="text">
For example, consider an <a href="https://webhost290.asu.edu:2222/CMD_FILE_MANAGER/domains/reasoning.eas.asu.edu/public_html/cplus2asp/examples/files/reactive/hanoi.txt">elaboration of the Tower of Hanoi problem</a> in language oBC+, where an antagonistic entity moves pegs in order to attempt to thwart the agent's efforts. The antagonistic entity's move is represented by external action ext_move.

Upon executing the command line

<pre class="code">	
cplus2asp --language=bc+ hanoi.obcp query=0
</pre>

Cplus2ASP operates under the reactive mode listening to external observations. To find a solution for the original problem (assuming no external input), one may insert 
<pre class="code">	
   #step.
   #endstep.
 </pre>
 as online stream. Cplus2ASP turns it into the input language of oClingo, runs oClingo and displays the reformatted output from oClingo using as2transition, and then again goes to the listening mode. One can then insert 

<pre class="code">
   #step.
   observed ext_move(p2,p3) at 2.
   #endstep.
</pre>
and so on. In each observation of external actions, Cplus2ASP does re-planning, but without grounding from scratch; only the new ground modules are added. This is highly effective in comparison with the offline execution, where  grounding has to be done from scratch each time the external move is observed.
