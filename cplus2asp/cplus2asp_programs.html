<h2>Programming for Cplus2ASP v3.1</h2>

<p class="text">
  Cplus2ASP allows for the specification of dynamic systems using one of several different <i>action languages</i>,
  declarative languages focusing on specifying a system by the actions that can be taken and their effects. Regardless
  of the selected language, the syntax accepted by Cplus2ASP is nearly identical. 
 </p>

<p class="text">
	A Cplus2ASP program typically consists of three components:
</p>
<ol>
	<li> symbol declarations, </li>
	<li> the program's main body, and </li>
	<li> one or more queries. </li>
</ol>

<p class="text">
	Each of these sections are described below in some detail. Additionally, examples can be found on the 
	<a href="./examples/index.html">Examples</a> page.
</p>

<h3> Symbol Declarations </h3>

	<p class="indented-text">
		User-defined identifiers in Cplus2ASP are divided up into 4 types: 
	</p>
	<ul class="indented">
		<li><h4>Objects</h4></li>
		<p class="indented-text">
			An object is a single instance of an element in the domain of consideration. These can be abstract
			concepts like <span class="code">true</span> and <span class="code">false</span>, physical objects
			like <span class="code">steve</span> and <span class="code">bob</span>.
		</p>
		<li><h4>Sorts</h4></li>
		<p class="indented-text">
			A sort finite group of 2 or more <i>objects</i> in the domain which are related to each other semantically.
			Sorts do not have to be disjoint. 
		</p>
		<p class="indented-text">
			As an example, there could be a sort <span class="code">people = {bob, alice, steve}</span> 
			enumerating the people relevant to the domain and a sort 
			<span class="code">targets = {steve, none}</span> listing potential targets. In this case
			<span class="code">steve</span> is both a person and a potential target. <span class="code">none</span>
			is a reserved object identifier Sindicating there is no target.
		</p>
		<li><h4>Constants</h4></li>
		<p class="indented-text">
			A (logical) constant is a fundamental component of a Cplus2ASP program which ranges over a sort of objects.
			The constant is able to take the value of any of the objects in its range. Logical constants in Cplus2ASP 
			can be divided up into two broad categories: fluents and actions. Fluents are then divided into simple fluents,
			statically determined fluents
		</p>
		<li><h4>Variables</h4></li>
		 <p class="indented-text">
			Schematic variables act as placeholders for each of the objects in the sort they range over. Their semantics are
			defined by a process known as <i>grounding</i> which copies each rule containing variables for each mapping
			from variables to objects in their respective ranges.
		 </p>
	</ul>

	<p class="indented-text">
		Symbols are declared in a Cplus2ASP program using a series of statements of the form:
	</p>
	<pre class="indented2-code">
:- &lt;type&gt; {&lt;declaration&gt;;} &lt;declaration&gt;.
	</pre>
	<p class="indented-text">
		Where type is the type of symbol being declared (one of <span class="code">objects, sorts, constants, </span> and 
		<span class="code">variables</span>) and each declaration consists of 
		<span class="code">&lt;identifier-declaration&gt;{,&lt;identifier-declaration&gt;} [:: &lt;specifier&gt;]</span>
		declarating one or more identifiers as being of the provided type.
	</p>
	
	<p class="indented-text">
		An <span class="code">&lt;identifier-declaration&gt;</span> is an identifier <span class="code">[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z_0-9]*</span> 
		which may optionally be followed by parameter list declaration <span class="code">(&lt;sort&gt;[, ...,&lt;sort&gt;])</span> if
		the symbol is a constant or object (sorts and variables cannot have parameters). 
	</p>
	<p class="indented-text">
		The <span class="code">specifier</span> is
		specific to the type of symbol being declared. Objects and sorts have no specifier, the specifier constants declares the sort
		it ranges over as well as the type of the constant (<span class="code">&lt;constant-type&gt;(&lt;sort&gt;)</span>), 
		the specifier for variables is simply the sort it ranges over.
	</p>
	<p class="indented-text">
		Valid <span class="code">constant-types</span> values include <span class="code">simpleFluent, sdFluent</span> (for 
		statically-determined fluents which depend only on the current system state),<span class="code">inertialFluent,</span> 
		(shorthand for a simple fluent which behaves inertially), <span class="code">,  action, </span> and 
		<span class="code">exogenousAction</span> (shorthand for an action with a builtin exogeneity assumption and therefore can occur 
		arbitrarily), and <span class="code">rigid</span> (a time-invariant constant). Additional valid values vary depending 
		on the language in use. If a constant-type is not provided it is assumed to be <span class="code">rigid</span>. 
	</p>
	<p class="indented-text">
		If a sort isn't specified for a constant it is assumed be <span class="code">boolean</span>, a special implicit sort ranging over
		<span class="code">{true, false}</span>.
	</p>
	
	
	
	<p class="indented-text">
		As an example, below is the symbol declarations from the monkey and bananas formalization <a href="examples/files/nmct/monkey.cp">
		monkey.cp</a>, as formalized in C+ in <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~hudson/papers/nmct.pdf">Nonmonotonic Causal Theories</a>.
	</p>
	<pre class="indented2-code">
:- sorts
	thing;
	location.

:- objects
	monkey,bananas,box     :: thing;
	l1,l2,l3               :: location.

:- variables
	L                      :: location.

:- constants
	loc(thing)             :: inertialFluent(location);
	hasBananas,onBox       :: inertialFluent;

	walk(location),
	pushBox(location),
	climbOn,
	climbOff,
	graspBananas           :: exogenousAction.
	</pre>
	<p class="indented-text">
		The declarations specify a sort <span class="code">thing = {monkey, bananas, box}</span> of physical objects in the domain of consideration
		and the sort <span class="code">location = {l1, l2, l3}</span> with variable <span class="code">L</span> of possible locations. 
		The fluent <span class="code">loc/1</span> maps <span class="code">things</span> to their current <span class="code">location</span> and the
		boolean fluents <span class="code">hasBananas</span> and <span class="code">onBox</span> track whether the monkey is holding the bananas and/or
		is on top of the box. Additionally, a number of boolean actions are declared that allow the monkey to walk to a location, push the box to a
		location, climb on/off the box, and grab the bananas.
	</p>
	

<h3> Program Body </h3>

	<p class="indented-text">
		Although each of the symbols in the previous example has an inteded intuitive meaning, they must be given formal semantics by a Cplus2ASP
		program which describes their relation to one-another.
		Cplus2ASP v3.1 currently supports several closely related action languages which can make up the body of the Cplus2ASP program, including:
	</p>
	<ul class="indented">
		<li>C+ (<a href="http://peace.eas.asu.edu/joolee/papers/nmct.pdf">Giunchiglia et. al. (2004)</a>),</li>
		<li>BC (<a href="http://peace.eas.asu.edu/joolee/papers/langbc-ijcai.pdf"> Lee et. al. (2013)</a>), and </li>
<!--
		<li>the prototype language BC+, which fully subsumes languages C+ and BC. </li>
-->
	</ul>
	
	<h4 class="indented"> Multi-Valued Propositional Formulas </h4>
	
	<p class="indented2-text">
		Regardless of which language is used for the program specification it is important to know the syntax enforced by Cplus2ASP for multi-valued
		formulas within body of each rule. This is described briefly below.
	</p>
	
	<p class="indented2-text">
		A multi-valued atom is an expression of the form <span class="code">&lt;constant&gt;=&lt;v&gt;</span> where <span class="code">&lt;constant&gt;</span> 
		is a constant identifier declared previously (with optional parameter list of objects and/or variables) and <span class="code">&lt;v&gt;</span> is
		an object in the range of <span class="code">&lt;constant&gt;</span> or a variable ranging over objects in the range of <span class="code">&lt;constant&gt;</span>. 
	</p>


	<p class="indented2-text">
		A multi-valued propositional formula is a logical formula built using , conjunction (<span class="code">&amp;</span> or <span class="code">,</span>), 
		disjunction (<span class="code">++</span>), negation (<span class="code">-</span> or <span class="code">not</span>), and implication (<span class="code">-&gt;&gt;</span>).
	
	</p>
	
	<p class="indented2-note">
		If <span class="code">&lt;constant&gt;</span> is a boolean constant (i.e. ranges of the <span class="code">boolean</span> sort) then an occurrence of
		<span class="code">&lt;constant&gt;</span> which otherwise would not be contained in an atom is considered shorthand for the atom
		<span class="code">&lt;constant&gt;=true</span>. Likewise, an occurrence of <span class="code">~&lt;constant&gt;</span> is taken to be shorthand for 
		<span class="code">&lt;constant&gt;=false</span>.
	</p>

	<p class="indented2-note">
		As an example, <span class="code">((p &amp; not q=3) ++ p=false)</span> where <span class="code">p</span> is boolean would be expanded to the multi-value
		formula <span class="code">((p=true &amp; not q=3) ++ p=false)</span>.
	</p>
	

	<p class="indented2-text">
		CPlus2ASP programs also support large conjunction and disjunction operators, <span class="code">[/\ &lt;V&gt; | &lt;F(V)&gt;]</span> and <span class="code">[\/ &lt;V&gt; | &lt;F(V)&gt;]</span>
		respectively where <span class="code">&lt;V&gt;</span> is a variable and <span class="code">&lt;F(V)&gt;</span> is a multi-valued propositional formula. These formulas are
		taken to be shorthand for <span class="code">F(v1) &amp; F(v2) &amp; ... &amp; F(vn)<span> and <span class="code">F(v1) ++ F(v2) ++ ... ++ F(vn)</span>, respectively,
		where the <span class="code">&lt;V&gt;</span> ranges over <span class="code">{v1, v2, ..., vn}</span>.
	</p>

	<p class="indented2-text">
		As a matter of convenience, CPlus2ASP also supports the shorthand syntax <span class="code">[&lt;op1&gt; &lt;V1&gt; ... &lt;opn&gt; &lt;Vn&gt; | &lt;F(V1,...,Vn)&gt;]</span>
		where each <span class="code">&lt;opi&gt; (i in 1..n)</span> is <span class="code">/\</span> or <span class="code">\/</span>. This expands into the formula
		<span class="code"> [&lt;op1&gt; &lt;V1&gt; | ... [&lt;opn&gt; &lt;Vn&gt; | &lt;F(V1,...,Vn)&gt; ]...]</span>.
	</p>

	<p class="indented2-text">
		As an example, given variables <span class="code">V1, V2</span> ranging over sorts <span class="code">S1={1,2},</span> and <span class="code">S2={a,b,c}</span> respectively,
		<span class="code">[/\ S1 \/ S2 | p(S1)=S2]</span> expands into the following multi-valued formula:
	<p>
	<pre class="indented3-code">
(p(1)=a ++ p(1)=b ++ p(1)=c) &amp; (p(2)=a ++ p(2)=b ++ p(2)=c)
	</pre>

	<p class="indented2-text">
		CPlus2ASP supports a number of builtin arithmetic and comparison operators which are evaluated during the program ground step when possible.
	</p>
	<table class="indented3-table">
		<tr><th>Operations		</th><th>	Symbol		</th><th>Operations		</th><th>	Symbol		</th></tr>
		<tr><td>Addition		</td><td>	+		</td><td>Subtraction		</td><td>	-		</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Multiplication		</td><td>	*		</td><td>Integer Division 	</td><td>	//		</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Modulus			</td><td>	mod		</td><td>Absolute Value		</td><td>	abs		</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Equality		</td><td>	==		</td><td>Inequality		</td><td>	\= or &lt;&gt;	</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Less than		</td><td>	&lt;		</td><td>Less than or equal	</td><td>	=&lt;		</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Greater than		</td><td>	&gt;		</td><td>Greater than or equal	</td><td>	&gt;=		</td></tr>
		
	</table>
	
	<p class="indented2-text">
		When one or more operand of these operators is a constant, the expression is unfolded using an itermediate variable. For example, given a sort
		<span class="code">s={1,2,3,4}</span> with variable <span class="code">V</span> and constants <span class="code">foo,bar</span> ranging over <span class="code">s</span>
		the expression <span class="code">foo=bar+1</span> is unfolded to <span class="code">foo=V+1 &amp; bar=V</span>. During grounding this then becomes
		<span class="code">foo=2 &amp; bar=1, foo=3 &amp; bar=2,</span> and <span class="code">foo=4 &amp; bar=3</span>.
	</p>



	<h4 class="indented">The Action Language C+ </h4>

	<p class="indented2-text">
		The Action Language C+, as described by <a href="http://peace.eas.asu.edu/joolee/papers/nmct.pdf">Giunchiglia et. al. (2004)</a>, was originally 
		formulated in terms of Causal Logic and its definite fragment was implemented in the system <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/tag/cc/">CCalc 2</a>. 
		<a href="http://ijcai.org/papers07/Papers/IJCAI07-057.pdf‎">Ferraris (2007)</a> later provided a reduction from definite causal logic to ASP which was then applied
		to C+ and implemented in the prototype version of Cplus2ASP (<a href="http://peace.eas.asu.edu/joolee/papers/cplus2asp.pdf"> Cassolary and Lee (2011)</a>). 
	</p>


	<p class="indented2-text">
		Giuchiglia et. al. (2004) described C+ as having three types of fundamental declarative laws: <i>static</i>, <i>action dynamic</i>, and <i>fluent dynamic</i> laws. 
		These laws are shown below in their respective order.
	</p>
	<pre class="indented3-code">
caused &lt;F&gt; [if &lt;G&gt;] [where &lt;K&gt;].
caused &lt;A&gt; [if &lt;L&gt;] [where &lt;K&gt;].
caused &lt;F&gt; [if &lt;G&gt;] after &lt;H&gt; [where &lt;K&gt;].
	</pre>

	<p class="indented2-text">
		Where:
	</p>
	<ul class="indented2">
		<li><span class="code">&lt;F&gt;</span> is <span class="code">false</span>, a multi-valued atom <span class="code">f=v</span> s.t. <span class="code">f</span> is a fluent, or a conjunction of such atoms,</li>
		<li><span class="code">&lt;G&gt;</span> is a multi-valued formula containing no action constants,</li>
		<li><span class="code">&lt;K&gt;</span> is a multi-valued formula containing no constants (i.e. containing only arithmetic operations and comparison on objects in variables),</li>
		<li><span class="code">&lt;A&gt;</span> is a multi-valued atom <span class="code">a=v</span> s.t. <span class="code">a</span> is an action or a conjunction of such atoms,</li>
		<li><span class="code">&lt;L&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;H&gt;</span> are multi-valued formulas.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="indented2-text">
		Informally C+ requires that all constants have a single value for each state / state transition which has a cause to hold.
	</p>
	<ul class="indented2">
		<li> A statical law reads that <span class="code">&lt;F&gt;</span> has cause to hold in the current state if <span class="code">&lt;G&gt;</span> holds (classically) in the current state and <span class="code">&gt;K&lt;</span> is satisfied.</li>
		<li> An action dynamic law reads that <span class="code">&lt;A&gt;</span> has cause to occur in the current transition if <span class="code">&lt;L&gt;</span> holds in the current state/transition  and <span class="code">&gt;K&lt;</span> is satisfied.</li>
		<li> A fluent dynamic law reads that <span class="code">&lt;F&gt;</span> has cause to hold in the next state if <span class="code">G</span> holds in the current state, <span class="code">&lt;H&gt;</span> held in the last state/transition, and <span class="code">&gt;K&lt;</span> is satisfied.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="indented2-note">
		Essentially the formula <span class="code">&lt;K&gt;</span> is used to control the grounding of the law. As an example, given the sort <span class="code">s={1,2,3}</span> with variable <span class="code">V</span>
		and fluent <span class="code">foo</span> of sort <span class="code">s</span>, the static law
	</p>
	<pre class="indented3-code">
caused foo=V if foo=V where V&lt;3.
	</pre> 
	<p class="indented2-note">
		is grounded into the laws
	</p>
	<pre class="indented3-code">
caused foo=1 if foo=1 where true.
caused foo=2 if foo=2 where true.
caused foo=3 if foo=3 where false.
	</pre>
	<p class="indented2-note">
		The last law is then dropped as the where clause is not satisified. The first two laws act as defaults for <span class="code">foo</span> and informally state that
		<span class="code">foo</span> <i>may</i> have cause to be 1 or 2. If <span class="code">foo</span> has no other assignment it will default to one of these values.
	</p>

	<p class="indented2-text">
		For a more complete understanding of the semantics of C+, we refer the reader to the formentioned papers which each describe the semantics in detail.
	</p>

	<p class="indented2-text">
		In addition, CPlus2ASP also supports a number of shorthand rules which are shown below alongside their expansion into one of the standard rule forms.
	</p>
	<table class="indented3-table">

		Finally, CPlus2ASP supports additive fluents and additive laws as described by <a href="http://peace.eas.asu.edu/joolee/papers/additive-ijcai.pdf">Lee and Lifschitz (2003)</a>.
		We refer the reader to review the formentioned paper for their syntax, semantics, and usage. Several examples are also provided on the <a href="/cplus2asp/examples/index.html">examples</a>

	<h4 class="indented" >The Action Language BC </h4>

	<p class="indented2-text">
		The action language BC is a recent language proposed by <a href="http://peace.eas.asu.edu/joolee/papers/langbc-ijcai.pdf"> Lee et. al. (2013) </a> in
		order to provide a language whose expressiveness subsumes languages B (<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/papers/refart.ps">Gelfond and Lifschitz (1998)</a>) 
		and C (<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/papers/c.ps">Giuchiglia and Lifschitz (1998)</a>) (C is the predecessor to language C+ and was originally implemented 
		in the original CCalc). 
	</p>

	<p class="indented2-text">
		BC's strength lies in the ability to represent concepts requiring strong-dependencies, such as transitive closure, allowed in language B,
		as well as the ability to describe non-inertial state properties such as those allowed by C. On the other hand, it does not fully subsume
		the action language C+ due to its heavily restricted syntax and built-in exogeneity assumption for all actions.
		
	</p>


	<p class="indented2-text">
		For information regarding language BC please see the <a href="/cplus2asp/examples/bc.html">BC</a> page or refer to <a href="http://peace.eas.asu.edu/joolee/papers/langbc-ijcai.pdf"> Lee et. al. (2013) </a>.

	<h4 class="indented" >The Action Language BC+ </h4>

	<p class="indented2-text">
		BC+ is a new language currently being prototyped whose semantics are defined directly in terms of a reduction to ASP. BC+ is meant to fully subsume
		languages C+ and BC as well as provide additional enhanced expressitivy inspired by features in ASP.

<h3> Queries </h3>

	<p class="indented-text">
		A Cplus2ASP program is intended to specify a complete system and all of its potential states. A Cplus2ASP places additional constraints
		on the system and its evolution over time to guide the search for a specific path or check additional properties of the system.
	</p>
	<p class="indented-text">
		All queries are of the form:
	</p>
	<pre class="indented2-code">
:- query
	[maxstep :: &lt;maxstep&gt;;]
	[label :: &lt;label&gt;;]
	{&lt;step&gt;: &lt;mv-formula&gt;;}
	&lt;step&gt;: &lt;mv-formula&gt;.
	</pre>
	<p class="indented-text">
		Where <span class="code">&lt;maxstep&gt;</span> is a natural number denoting the (optional) maximum length of plan to generate 
		(Cplus2ASP does not enforce an upperbound by default), <span class="code">&lt;label&gt;</span> is an identifier indicating
		the name the query will be referenced by while running Cplus2ASP, and each <span class="code">&lt;step&gt;: &lt;mv-formula&gt;</span>
		constrains the state at step <span class="code">&lt;step&gt;</span> (either a natural number of the keyword <span class="code">maxstep</span>) 
		so that it must classically satisfy the multi-valued formula <span class="code">&lt;mv-formula&gt;</span>.
	</p>
	
	<p class="indented-text">
		If no label is specified for a query then it defaults to <span class="code">0</span>. Additionally, multiple queries can be specified
		for a single program provided each of them has a unique label.
	</p>
	
	<p class="indented-text">
		As an example, the three queries below are for the monkey and bananas domain.
	</p>
	<pre class="indented2-code">
:- query
	maxstep :: 2;
	label :: prediction;
	0: loc(monkey)=l1, 
	    loc(bananas)=l2,
	    loc(box)=l3,
	    walk(l3);
	1: pushBox(l2);
	2: loc(monkey)\= loc(bananas) ++ loc(bananas)\=loc(box).

:- query
	maxstep :: 2;
	label :: postdiction;
	0: walk(l3);
	1: [\/L | pushBox(L)];
	0: loc(box)\=l3.

:- query
	label :: planning;
	0: loc(monkey)=l1,
	    loc(bananas)=l2,
	    loc(box)=l3;
	maxstep: hasBananas.
	</pre>
	<p class="indented-text">
		Each of these queries ask a specific question, as detailed below: 
	</p>
	<ul class="indented">
	    <li> The first (<span class="code">prediction</span>) asks "If the monkey, bananas, and box were at
		l1, l2, and l3, respectively, and the monkey walks to l3 and pushes the box to l2, is there anyway the monkey, box, and bananas are not at the
		same location?" </li>
	    <li> The second (<span class="code">postdiction</span>) asks "If the monkey walks to l3 and pushes the box <i>anywhere</i>, is there any way the box
		wasn't at l3?"</li>
	    <li> The third (<span class="code">planning</span>) asks "If the monkey, bananas, and box are at l1, l2, and l3, respectively, how should the monkey
		get the bananas?"</li>
	</ul>
	
<h3> Other Special Statements </h3>

	<p class="indented-text">
		CPlus2ASP also supports several additional constructs to facilitate an enhanced user experience. Among them are <i>include statements</i>,
		<i>macros</i>, and LUA functions.
	</p>
	<p class="indented-text">
		 An include statement allows for the contents of an entire external file to be included into the CPlus2ASP program and is of the form: 
	</p>
	<pre class="indented2-code">
:- include &lt;file&gt;.	
	</pre>
	<p class="indented-text">
		Where <span class="code">&lt;file&gt;</span> is the name of the file to include relative to the current working path OR the current file's
		location. <span class="code">&lt;file&gt;</span> may be optionally surrounded by parentheses (required if the file name includes spaces). 
	</p>

	<p class="indented-text">
		Macros are identifiers which are expanded as a preprocess to translation into a defined string. User-defined macros are declared similar to
		other identifiers using a statement of the following form: 
	</p>

	<pre class="indented2-code">
:- macros
	{&lt;identifier&gt; -&gt; &lt;expansion&gt;;}
	&lt;identifier&gt; -&gt; &lt;expansion&gt;.
	</pre>
	<p class="indented-text">
		Where each <span class="code">identitifer -&gt; &lt;expansion&gt;</span> declares an identifier with optional parameter list
		<span class="code">(#1, #2, ..., #n)</span> of expansion parameters and <span class="code">&lt;expansion&gt;</span> is the string
		the identifier should expand to possibly containing the specified expansion parameters.
	</p>

	<p class="indented-text">
		As an example, given the macro definition
	</p>
	<pre class="indented2-code">
:- macros
    UNIQUE(#1, #2, #3) -> (#1(#2) &amp; [ /\ #3 | #3 \= #2 ->> -#1(#3)]).
	</pre>
	<p class="indented-text">
		 the string <span class="code">[ \/ V1 | UNIQUE(p,V1,V2) ]</span> expands to the multi-valued formula
	</p>
	<pre class="indented2-code">
[ \/ V1 | (p(V1) &amp; [ /\ V2 | V2 \= V1 ->> -p(V2)]) ].
	</pre>

	<p class="indented-note">
		A caveat to macro expansion is that tokens cannot extend across macros. This means that a macro <span class="code">foo(#1) -> #1</span> occurring
		in the context <span class="code">"foo(b)ar"</span> will actually be expanded to <span class="code">"b ar"</span>, not <span class="code">"bar"</span>.
	</p>

	<p class="indented-text">
		LUA is a scripting language which is supported by Gringo 3 and Gringo 4 to embed external logic (such as database lookups) into ASP programs which are
		evaluated during program grounding. CPlus2ASP v3 and Cplus2asp v3.1 also provides suppports for this feature as is described on the <a href="/cplus2asp/examples/lua.html">LUA</a>
		page.
