<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

<p>Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) is an exciting, well-established 
field of research. In KRR a fundamental assumption is that an agent's 
knowledge is explicitly represented in a declarative form, suitable for 
processing by dedicated reasoning engines. This assumption, that much of 
what an agent deals with is knowledge-based, is common in many modern 
intelligent systems. Consequently, KRR has contributed to the theory and 
practice of various areas in AI, such as automated planning, natural language 
understanding, among others, as well as to fields beyond AI, including 
databases, verification, and software engineering. In recent years KRR has 
contributed to new and emerging fields including the semantic web, 
computational biology, and the development of software agents.
</p>

<p>The KR conference series is the leading forum for timely in-depth presentation 
of progress in the theory and principles underlying the representation and 
computational management of knowledge.</p>

<p>We solicit two kinds of papers: <b>full papers</b>, presenting novel results on the principles of KRR that clearly contribute to the formal foundations of relevant problems or show the applicability of results to implemented or implementable systems; and <b>short papers</b> describing applications, systems and/or demos, reports from the field of applications, experiments, developments, and tests. We also welcome (full or short) papers from other areas that show clear use of, or contributions to, the principles or practice of KRR.</p>

<p>The best paper of the conference will receive the 2018 Ray Reiter Best Paper Prize, and the best student paper, whose main author is a student, will receive the 2018 Marco Cadoli Student Paper Prize. In addition, a few selected papers from KR 2018 will have the opportunity for fast-track publication in the AI Journal, and the best 1-2 papers in the area of logic programming or answer set programming will have the opportunity for fast-track publication in TPLP.</p>
