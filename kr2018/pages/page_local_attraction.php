<h1>Local Attraction</h1>
<br/>


<p>In the heart of the American Southwest, Arizona is filled with natural wonders, vibrant cities, and charming small towns. The Grand Canyon draws tourists from around the globe, but those who venture deeper into the state will find all kinds of unique places and interesting sites. While cities and towns like Phoenix and Sedona make great vacation destinations, you can head beyond the urban centers to discover Native American cliff dwellings and remnants of ancient cultures, historic ghost towns from the mining days, and a landscape perfect for outdoor adventures. Arizona is home to desert, lakes, mountains, slot canyons, saguaro cactus, buttes, waterfalls, and even a volcano with downhill skiing, all of which offer a world of possibilities for travelers.</p></br>

<h2>3. Grand Canyon</h2>
<p>Standing on the rim of the Grand Canyon looking out over the endless ridges of colorful cliff walls and deep ravines, it's impossible not to be inspired by this natural wonder. The canyon walls glow in the late afternoon sun, revealing hues of orange, red, yellow, and everything in between. One of the biggest attractions in America, and certainly in the state of Arizona, the Grand Canyon is nothing less than spectacular. This incredible landscape has been carved out by the Colorado River, seen in the distance far below.

Most visitors see the canyon from the South Rim, where there are numerous lookout areas all along the road, and walkways running along the canyon's edge. The North Rim provides a different view altogether, but the road is closed in winter. For those who want a closer look, it is possible to hike down into the Grand Canyon or take a helicopter flight over and through the canyon.</p></br>


<h2>4. Hoover Dam</h2>
<p>Hoover Dam is one of the world's great engineering marvels. This massive structure, completed in 1935, crosses the Colorado River, linking Arizona and Nevada. It is 726 feet high and 1,244 feet long. Lake Mead, held back by the Hoover Dam, is the largest artificial lake in the United States. It is 110 miles long, and holds the equivalent of two years of flow of the Colorado River.</p>

<p>Visitors can drive or walk across the dam for free, although there is a charge for parking. Another option is to take a tour of Hoover Dam or the Powerplant. On site is the visitor center, with information on the dam and tours, and a café with some basic food options.</p></br>

<h2>5. Sedona</h2>
<p>Surrounded by stunning red rock mountains and buttes, Sedona has one of the most beautiful settings in Arizona. About a 1.5-hour drive north of Phoenix, Sedona is a popular day trip from the city, but the town is worthy of much more than just a few hours. The drive into town from the south, through the Village of Oak Creek, is stunning and offers numerous scenic pullouts.</p>

<p>Sedona's main street (89A) is full of interesting tourist shops, art galleries, and restaurants and is an easy place to spend an afternoon. All around Sedona, you'll find great hiking and mountain biking trails, but Jeep tours, one of the most popular things to do here, provide an even easier way to get out into the landscape. Also in the surrounding area are a number of ancient Native American dwellings, which you can visit on your own or as part of a Jeep tour.</p>

<p>Sedona is considered by many to be a highly spiritual place. It is known for its energy vortexes, found at a number of sites around the town. In downtown, you'll also find New Age shops and unique opportunities, from UFO tours and aura readings to psychics and crystal sellers.</p></br>

<h2>6. Monument Valley</h2>
<p>One of the most iconic images of the Southwest are the sandstone buttes that dominate Monument Valley. This area, straddling the border between Arizona and Utah, includes jagged rock formations, stone spires and buttes, and sand dunes. At the heart of the valley is the Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, where you'll find an impressive visitor center and a 17-mile self-drive route along a one-way gravel road through the park. You can also take a guided tour to explore the area more thoroughly. If you don't have time to go into the park, you can appreciate some of the views from the highway.</p></br>

<h2>7. Glen Canyon National Recreation Area</h2>
<p>The Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is a stunning region of blue water, desert landscape, and dramatic stone walls. Home to Lake Powell, one of the largest manmade lakes in the United States, this area is known for both land-based and water-based recreational activities.</p>

<p>The Glen Canyon Dam was constructed between 1956 and 1964 to block the Colorado River and create Lake Powell. There is still a 15 mile section of Glen Canyon downstream from the Glen Canyon Dam, which stretches from the dam down to Lees Ferry.</p>

<p>The town of Page is a good base for exploring the Glen Canyon National Recreation area and surrounding region. The largest marina on Lake Powell, Wahweap Marina, is located just 7 miles north of Page. One of the area's biggest attractions is the nearby slot canyons of Antelope Canyon. Depending on the section of the canyon, visitors can either simply walk through a narrow slot canyon with shafts of light penetrating through the top, illuminating the red walls, or repel down into a canyon. Photos of Antelope Canyon are often found on postcards or in fine art galleries. Visitors can visit Antelope Canyon on a guided tour.</p></br>

<h2>8. Havasu Falls</h2>
<p>Near Supai on the Havasupai Indian Reservation is the 100-foot Havasu Falls. The pools at the base of Havasu Falls have a bluish green tint to the water, and the fall is forked so it appears that there are two falls when the river is flowing heavily. In the canyon of Havasu Creek, a tributary of the Colorado River, some 450 Havasupai Indians (the "people of the blue-green water") live a secluded life, subsisting on their modest farming activities but now mainly dependent on the tourist trade. In this paradisiac valley the Havasu have created a number of waterfalls and carved out basins in the travertine rock which form attractive bathing pools.

Day hiking is not allowed here. Visitors need to make reservations, obtain a permit, and pay a fee. Access is via a long hike, horseback or mule, or helicopter.</p></br>

</div></br>


<h2>9. Canyon De Chelly National Monument</h2>
<p>Canyon de Chelly National Monument is home to spectacular Native American cliff dwellings set along steep-sided canyons, with walls up to 1,000 feet high. In the main canyon, some of the key attractions are the White House Ruins, constructed circa 1050 and discovered in 1849, and Spider Rock. The White House is the best known of the more than one hundred cliff dwellings. The only self-guided hike in the park, which leaves from the White House Overlook on the South Rim, descends 600 feet to the White House Ruins. Other cliff dwellings include the Antelope House and Mummy Cave (in which mummies were found) in the Canyon del Muerto. Most of the ruins, which are largely inaccessible to visitors, were occupied from around AD 350 to 1300.</p>

<p>You can tour the site on your own by driving along the North and South Rim Drives and stopping at the pullouts. Although you can easily see ruins nearby, many of the lookouts also have scopes that let you pinpoint ruins on the distant walls. From spring until fall, you can join a free ranger-led hike or take a private tour of the canyon.</p></br>


<h2>10. Bisbee</h2>
<p>In the far south of Arizona, near the Mexico border, is one of Arizona's most interesting towns and possibly one of its best kept secrets. The former mining town of Bisbee is a unique little community set high in the mountains.</p>

<p>After the mines here closed, Bisbee became a ghost town, and squatters took up residence. Eventually, the town became a haven for artists and hippies. Today, it is a prosperous small town with an eclectic mix of residents, all kinds of unique shops and restaurants, and many interesting things to see and do. Homes, many of which are former miners' cabins, line the hills surrounding the historic downtown area. Many of these residences are only accessible via long sets of stairs that lead to the town center below. Views from the upper streets and hillside homes are incredible, looking out over mountains all the way to Mexico. In the hills above town are a number of informal hiking trails.</p>

<p>Bisbee is a popular day trip from Tucson and surrounding areas, often combined with a stop in Tombstone.</p></br>




<h2>11. Lake Mead National Recreation Area</h2>
<p>Lake Mead National Recreation Area spans 177 miles of the Colorado River and includes Lake Mead and Lake Mohave. The area's 1.5 million acres stretches into southern Nevada.</p>

<p>The area offers boating and water sports, camping facilities, fishing, and hiking opportunities. Lake Mohave is 67 miles long, making it the smaller of the two major lakes in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. Like its counterpart, Lake Mohave is an artificial body of water, held back by Davis Dam. Willow Beach is a small resort town on the Colorado River with accommodation, restaurants, a marina, and fish hatchery.</p></br>

<h2>12. Petrified Forest National Park</h2>
<p>Large pieces of petrified wood, along with fossilized plants, fish, and reptiles, have been revealed in great numbers in what is today Petrified National Forest in the Painted Desert. The park access road allows visitors to drive passed many of the highlights and short interpretive trails allow for close up looks at a variety of unique sights. The Visitors Center provides insight into the ecology and geology of the park and is a good place to start before heading out on the drive.</p></br>

<h2>13. Antelope Canyon at Page</h2>
<p>Seen in countless photographs in galleries all over Arizona, Antelope Canyon is a slot canyon located just outside of Page. The sculpted, twisting sandstone walls rise up around you, with shafts of light breaking through from the narrow opening above as you walk through the canyon. Visitors can tour Upper Antelope Canyon on a guided tour, although once you reach the canyon, you are given plenty of free time to explore on your own and at your own pace. The canyon lies within the Navajo Nation reserve boundary.</p></br>
