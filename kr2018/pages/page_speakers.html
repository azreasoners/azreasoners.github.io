<b>Talk Title</b><br/>
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning for Cognition-enabled Robot Manipulation
<br/><br/>
<b>Abstract</b><br/>
<p>Robotic agents that can accomplish manipulation tasks with the competence of humans have been the holy grail for AI and robotics research for more than 50 years. However, while the fields made huge progress over the years, this ultimate goal is still out of reach. I believe that this is the case because the knowledge representation and reasoning methods that have been proposed in AI so far are necessary but still too abstract. In this talk I propose to endow robots with the capability to mentally "reason with their eyes and hands'', that is to internally emulate and simulate their perception-action loops based on photo-realistic images and faithful physics simulations, which are made machine-understandable by casting them as virtual symbolic knowledge bases. These capabilities allow robots to generate huge collections of machine- understandable manipulation experiences, which they can then generalize into commonsense and intuitive physics knowledge applicable to open manipulation task domains. The combination of learning, representation, and reasoning will equip robots with an understanding of the relation between their motions and the physical effects they cause at an unprecedented level of realism, depth, and breadth, and enable them to master human-scale manipulation tasks. This breakthrough will be achievable by combining simulation and visual rendering technologies with mechanisms to semantically interpret internal simulation data structures and processes.</p>

<b>Talk Title</b><br/>
Using Deep Learning Platforms to Perform Inference over Knowledge Bases
</br><br/>
<b>Abstract</b><br/>
<p>Diffent subcommunities of artificial intelligence have focused on different toolkits, containing different computational methods and analytic techniques. The knowledge representation (KR) and logic programming (LP) communities have focused on non-probabilistic first-order inference, and has relied heavily on computational complexity as guidance for design of inference systems; the probabilistic logic (PL) community has focused on probabilistic robust inference, but has large focused on inference methods that are computationally expensive and hence do not scale to large knowledge bases; the automatic knowledge-base construction (AKBC) community has focused on constructing and using very large amounts of simple structured information; and the machine learning (ML) community has focused on learning from data how to perform simple probabilistic operations like classification. Recently progress in ML has been greatly accelerated by high-performance, easily programmable tools for defining and optimizing deep neural-network architectures.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will summarize the most recent results in my attempts to bridge all of these areas. Specifically, I will describe a system that learns from data how to perform non-trivial probabilistic first-order inference tasks, efficiently, in a manner that scales with large KBs. The system I will describe, TensorLog, is a carefully restricted probabilistic first-order logic in which inference can be compiled to differentiable functions in a neural network infrastructure, such as Tensorflow. This enables one to use high-performance deep learning frameworks to learn parameters of a probabilistic logic. TensorLog has been used for several diverse tasks, including semi-supervised learning for network data (using logic constraints on classifiers), question-answering against a KB, and relational learning.</p>

Commonsense Knowledge: a Grand Challenge for Academic AI Research
<br/><br/>
<b>Abstract</b><br/>
<p>In a world obsessed by deep learning, how are KR researchers to make meaningful progress? I’ll address this conundrum by re-visiting one of the holy grails of AI: acquiring, representing, and utilizing common-sense knowledge. How can we leverage modern methods including deep learning, NLP, and crowd sourcing to build more principled AI systems that cross the chasm between these methods and KR research?</p>

<b>Talk Title</b><br/>
Knowledge and Reasoning in Ethically Aligned AI Systems
<br/><br/>
<b>Abstract</b><br/>
<p>AI systems are increasingly acting in the same environment as humans, in areas as diverse as driving, assistive technology, and health care. Humans and machines will often need to work together and agree on common decisions. This requires alignment around some common moral values and ethical principles. Humans will accept and trust more machines that behave at least as ethically as other humans in the same environment. Moreover, shared moral values and ethical principles will help in collective human-machine decision making, where consensus or compromise is needed. In this scenario, end-to-end machine learning does not seem to provide all the necessary capabilities (such as explainability, value alignment, and fairness) to build trust in AI systems, and should be suitably combined with KR techniques that can help in modelling ethical priorities and reason with them. In this talk I will present some challenges in designing ethically aligned AI systems that humans can trust, and describe possible technical solutions for such challenges, based on a combination of machine learning techniques with knowledge modelling and reasoning components.<p>

<b>Talk Title</b><br/>
Answer Set Programming - a story of default negation, definitions and informal semantics
<br/><br/>
<b>Abstract</b><br/>
<p>After about two decades in existence, Answer Set Programming (ASP) has earned a prominent position as one of the most commonly used knowledge representation languages owing its appeal to intuitive, flexible and expressive syntax, a sound programming methodology, and an impressive effectiveness of software for processing programs. The source of its success lies in years of research in knowledge representation, logic programming, satisfiability, and constraint satisfaction. ASP has been able to build on accomplishments in each of these areas, reaching an elegant balance between expressivity, ease of use, and computational effectiveness. In this talk I will examine the main research themes that first led to formulation of ASP as a computational paradigm for declarative problem modeling and solving, and that still continue to this day to influence how ASP evolves. They concern the default negation and its close relative, negation as failure, with their connections to commonsense reasoning research, logic programming, and nonmonotonic logics of early 1980s; definitions, how they shaped some early research in logic programming and how they turned critical for the way programs in ASP are now commonly developed; and finally the all important matter of informal semantics with its power to validate formal concepts and offer guidance on how to represent formally atomic pieces of knowledge and how to combine them together.</p>
